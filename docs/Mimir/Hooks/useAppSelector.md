# useAppSelector

The `useAppSelector` hook is a custom hook that is often used in Redux Toolkit-based applications to replace the standard `useSelector` hook from the `react-redux` library. The purpose of this custom hook is to provide type safety for the Redux store's state when using TypeScript.

Here's a typical definition of `useAppSelector`:

```typescript
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { RootState } from "../store"; // Import your RootState type

export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

### How it Works:

1. **TypedUseSelectorHook**: This is a generic type that takes the type of the root state of your Redux store. It helps in providing type safety when you use the `useSelector` hook.

2. **useSelector**: This is the standard hook from `react-redux` that allows you to extract data from the Redux store state, using a selector function.

3. **RootState**: This is the type of the root state of your Redux store. It's usually defined when you combine your reducers.

By using `useAppSelector`, you can ensure that the selector functions you write are type-safe and will provide autocompletion and error checking based on the types defined in your Redux store's state.

### Usage:

You would use `useAppSelector` in the same way you use `useSelector`. For example:

```typescript
const someData = useAppSelector((state) => state.someReducer.someData);
```

This ensures that `state.someReducer.someData` is type-safe and will give you TypeScript errors if you try to access properties that do not exist on `someData`.
