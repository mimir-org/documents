<details><summary>I don't get the email from registering, what's happening?</summary>
If you're not receiving the email, it's because it doesn't get sent when you're running in development mode; the same applies to the account recovery code. The email you should have received can be found in:

`/mimirorg/typelibrary/src/server/TypeLibrary.Api/bin/Debug/net7.0/Data/Mail/`
