# Type Creation Process

If you have not yet registered as a Tyle user, please refer to the [User Registration Guide](registering-user.md). This
guide also provides valuable information on setting up authentication, logging in, and obtaining the necessary
permissions.

## Overview of the Tyle Main Interface

The Tyle main interface serves as a hub for various functionalities such as searching for types, creating, editing,
cloning, deleting, and either requesting or granting approval for a type, contingent upon your permission level. The
screenshot below illustrates an interface for a user without any permissions, where the 'Create' button is disabled:

### Utilizing the Filter Menu

The filter menu can be employed to narrow down the list to specific types:

### Object Creation with Write Permission

Users endowed with 'Write' permissions have the capability to create new objects:

In the following screenshot, a user initiates the creation of a new 'Aspect Object':

### Object Status and Actions

Upon creation, the aspect object will be in a 'Draft' status. During this phase, the user has the options to clone,
edit, request approval, or delete the object:

### Approval Process

Once the user is content with the newly created type, they can proceed to 'request approval'. The status will then
transition to 'Pending Approval'. Subsequently, a user with at least 'Approve' access level is required to validate the
new type. Upon approval, a confirmation email will be sent to you.
