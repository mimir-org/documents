### Step 1: Create a New Slice File

Create a new file for your slice, e.g., `newFeatureSlice.ts`, inside the `src/client/src/store/` directory.

---

### Step 2: Import Dependencies

Import the necessary modules from Redux Toolkit and any other dependencies you may need.

```typescript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```

---

### Step 3: Define Initial State

Define the initial state for your slice. This can be an object, array, or any other data type.

```typescript
const initialState = {
  data: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
};
```

---

### Step 4: Create the Slice

Use the `createSlice` function to create a slice. Define your reducers within the `reducers` object.

```typescript
const newFeatureSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'newFeature',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    fetchDataStart: (state) => {
      state.loading = true;
    },
    fetchDataSuccess: (state, action: PayloadAction<any>) => {
      state.data = action.payload;
      state.loading = false;
    },
    fetchDataFailure: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.error = action.payload;
      state.loading = false;
    },
  },
});
```

---

### Step 5: Export Actions

Export the actions generated by `createSlice`.

```typescript
export const { fetchDataStart, fetchDataSuccess, fetchDataFailure } = newFeatureSlice.actions;
```

---

### Step 6: Export Reducer

Export the reducer so it can be combined with other reducers in the store.

```typescript
export default newFeatureSlice.reducer;
```

---

### Step 7: Update Root Reducer

In your `commonReducer.ts` or equivalent, import the new reducer and add it to the root reducer.

```typescript
import newFeatureReducer from './newFeatureSlice';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // ...other reducers,
  newFeature: newFeatureReducer,
});
```

---

### Step 8: Create and Export Selectors

Create selectors to read specific pieces of state. You can place these in a `selectors.ts` file or within your slice file.

```typescript
export const selectNewFeatureData = (state: RootState) => state.newFeature.data;
```

---

### Step 9: Use Actions in Components

Now you can use the actions and selectors in your React components using `useDispatch` and `useSelector`.

```typescript
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const data = useSelector(selectNewFeatureData);

dispatch(fetchDataStart());
```
