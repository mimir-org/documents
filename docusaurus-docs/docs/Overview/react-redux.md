# Extend Functionality

## 1. Setting up the Store

The store is set up in `src/client/src/store/index.ts`. It uses Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` method to create the store.
```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './commonReducer';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});
```

## 2. Reducers

Reducers are defined in separate files like `commonReducer.ts`, `libraryReducer.ts`, and `projectReducer.ts`. They handle state changes based on actions.
```typescript
// commonReducer.ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const commonSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'common',
  initialState: {},
  reducers: {
    // Your reducers here
  },
});
```

## 3. Actions

Actions are automatically generated by Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` method.
```typescript
export const { someAction } = commonSlice.actions;
```

## 4. Hooks

Custom hooks are defined in `hooks.ts` for easier interaction with the store.
```typescript
// hooks.ts
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
```

## 5. Selectors

Selectors are defined in `selectors.ts` to read specific pieces of state.
```typescript
// selectors.ts
export const selectCommon = (state: RootState) => state.common;
```

## 6. API Calls

API calls are made using Axios and are defined in `.api.ts` files like `common.api.ts`.
```typescript
// common.api.ts
export const fetchSomething = () => axios.get('/some/endpoint');
```

## 7. Saga

Saga is used for side effects and is defined in `saga.ts`.
```typescript
// saga.ts
function* watchFetchSomething() {
  yield takeLatest(fetchSomething.type, fetchSomethingSaga);
}
```
